# Shin Kiwami Generator

Made with `React`, `Redux`, `HTML` and `CSS`.

## About

- Create character introduction screens like the ones in the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) videogame series! Have you ever imagined being a part of the series? Now you can do it with style, as they do many unforgettable characters such as Kiryu, Nishiki, Kuze, Saeko, Majima, Akiyama, Kiyomi, Date and so many more! You can even play the animation the exact same way like in the videogame, with the sound effect and the fade to white and black and all. Isn't that cool?
- This is a remake of the [Kiwami Introduction Generator](https://github.com/Roselcost/kiwamigenerator), an application I made back in 2020. The goal back then was to have some practice on Vue and do something fun meanwhile.
- The main reason why I remade this app was because I wanted to have a more polished version, since many people are using it and, honestly, the first version was kinda embarassing in some ways and you deserve better. Also, I was looking for a side project to do using React and this was perfect for the task. This time I aimed to replicate the UI of the latest Like a Dragon games, such as Infinite Wealth. Hope you like it.
- Many people asked me about downloading the video of the effect. Sadly, it's quite challenging to do so. I tried several approaches like trying to take screenshots for each frame in the first second of the animation (the whole animated part) and join them together but I could only get like 15 frames at best in that timeframe with the current library I'm using. So please, stick to using another application to record a fragment of your screen. I'm so sorry for that!
